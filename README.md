# Predicting employee attrition and retention strategies
The goal of this project was to provide information to the HR department on a likelihood of an employee attrition (quitting the current job) using prediction driven by a machine learning classification algorithms.
Such a decission might be dictated by a multitude of factors, professional as well as personal.

## Data Set

[HR Analytics Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saadharoon27/hr-analytics-dataset/data)\
**Structured:** Yes\
**Format:** single .csv file\
**Size:** 1480 observations (unique: 1470)\
**Number of Features:** 38\
**Target Feature (Vector)**: Attrition, imbalanced, 16.1:83.9\
**NA Values**: 57/1480, all in one Feature (YearsWithCurrManager)\
**Duplicates**: 7 (All Features) + 3 (EmployeeNumber / EmpID)

## Challenges

- relatively small amount of observations in the data set for ML Model training
- imbalanced target classes distribution
- finding a good scoring metric applicable to the prediction (custom scoring - f2)
