target column: "Attrition"

columns to drop...
    ...right away because they don't provide any relevant information:
        "EmpID", "EmployeeCount", "EmployeeNumber", "StandardHours", "Over18"

delete/impute missing data:
    "YearsWithCurrManager": nan -> ? (Maybe determine imputation via GridSearch: 0 or median)

edit columns:
    "Attrition": "Yes" -> 1, "No" -> 0
    "OverTime": "Yes" -> 1, "No" -> 0
    "Gender": "Female" -> 1, "Male" -> 0
    "BusinessTravel": "Non-Travel" -> 0
                      'TravelRarely' -> 1
                      'Travel_Rarely' -> 1
                      "Travel_Frequently" -> 2

drop duplicates

######### NO! ##########
assign categorical orders to ordinal categories:
    "BusinessTravel": 'Non-Travel', 'Travel_Rarely', 'Travel_Frequently'
    (leave "AgeGroup" and "SalarySlab" as nominal categories!)
########################

consider PCA for "Years..."-columns. Do not include "YearsSinceLastPromotion".

Target is unbalanced. 
    -> Account for that in the pipeline. (For SVC, just set class_weight="balanced")

Data is kinda semi-sorted.
    -> Randomize train/test-split
    -> Basically, shuffle at every turn

Try out dropping...
    complete rows:
        "PerformanceRating"
    features after encoding:
        AgeGroup "55+"
        JobRole "Research Scientist", "Sales Executive"

Maybe take a closer look at the peculiar pattern in the MonthlyIncome/TotalWorkingYears-pairing
